# Model Comparison: Decision Tree vs Random Forest

This project compares two machine learning algorithms — Decision Tree and Random Forest — on the Breast Cancer dataset. The goal is to evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Contents
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Preprocessing (scaling, outlier handling)
- Feature Importance Analysis
- Model Implementation
- Cross-Validation Results
- Final Comparison

## Summary
Random Forest performed significantly better than Decision Tree, particularly in accuracy and generalization ability. The full analysis and charts are available in the notebook and report.
